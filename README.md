# UnityTest

A test dupe of Pong made in Unity. Created to get a solid foundation with important elements of Unity after my group project Epoch.

Started: 4/26/2025
Completed: 5/7/2025

The game includes:
- Singleplayer vs an AI (AI uses raycasting to determine the ball endpoint, it also has random error and delay that gets worse the faster the ball goes)
- Local multiplayer
- Start menu, pause menu, win screen
- Full controller support

There are a few things that I may go back and add, but I could essentially do that forever.
My current list of possible future additions includes:
- A filter to look like an old TV (depends on if it looks good)
- An endless mode with a high score (you go until you get scored on once by the AI)
- Slight changes to the menu, I'd change the auto-select to only select once controller input is detected (this is the first change I would make and will likely be done this month)

For now, I'm moving on to one of my ideas, my next game should take roughly a month to make, this game was done casually over roughly two weeks.

I learned a lot about the basics of UI, sound, designing AI, controller support, and how long it takes to make certain things.
Despite being a lot simpler than my first game, I am more proud of this one, where I did everything and I wasn't distracted by school as much.
Creating the AI took almost all of the time, I made so many small alterations to it while I made other parts of the game. I found that making the bones was quick. I had a playable version of the local multiplayer within the first few hours of the project.

The sound in this game was found on Freesound by the user NoiseCollector.
